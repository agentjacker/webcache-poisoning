# webcache-poisoning

Web cache poisoning is a type of attack that involves manipulating the contents of a web cache in order to deliver malicious content to unsuspecting users. A web cache is a mechanism that stores frequently accessed web pages and other content, such as images, in a server or in a user's browser. The use of web caches is intended to reduce server load and speed up page load times.

In a web cache poisoning attack, an attacker sends specially crafted requests to a web cache with the goal of injecting malicious content into the cache. When a user later accesses the same content, they may receive the malicious content instead of the legitimate content stored in the original server.

An example of a web cache poisoning attack involves exploiting the behavior of some web servers and proxies that use the HTTP Host header to determine which website to serve. An attacker sends a request with a malicious Host header to a caching proxy, which caches the response from the malicious website. When an unsuspecting user later accesses the same URL, the caching proxy serves the cached response from the malicious website, instead of the legitimate content from the original server.

Another example involves exploiting vulnerabilities in the way web caches handle HTTP response headers. An attacker sends a request with a specially crafted Cache-Control header that tricks the web cache into caching and serving malicious content.

Web cache poisoning can lead to serious security issues, such as phishing attacks, malware distribution, and data theft. To prevent web cache poisoning, website owners and operators should regularly audit their web caches and implement appropriate security controls, such as validating and sanitizing user input and response headers, and implementing secure caching policies.
